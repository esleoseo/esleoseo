<a>This installation honors the legacy of United Nations veterans who served and sacrificed their lives during the Korean War, many of whom are memorialized at the UN Memorial Cemetery in Busan, Korea. Inspired by the annual Turn Toward Busan ceremony, organized by the Korean Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs, the installation reflects the global act of remembrance on November 11, where people across the world observe a moment of silence while facing Busan in honor of these veterans.</a>
<br><br>
<a>The installation features footprints cast from M-48 combat boots, a model worn by American UN veterans during the war. Positioned to face Busan, these footprints invite participants to symbolically "stand in the shoes" of those who could not return home. By aligning themselves with the direction of Busan, viewers are encouraged to reflect on the journey of these veterans and the enduring significance of their sacrifice.</a>
<br><br>
<a>The primary color of the installation is the official blue of the United Nations, symbolizing the organization’s commitment to peace and global unity.</a>
